## Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict the age of individuals based on their health metrics and lifestyle choices. The model is trained using a dataset that includes various attributes, and it employs a Random Forest Regressor for age prediction. The code performs several key tasks:

1. **Data Loading**: Reads the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms the data to make it suitable for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creates new features and encodes categorical variables.
4. **Model Training**: Splits the data into training and testing sets, scales the features, and trains a Random Forest model.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Randomized Search Cross-Validation to find the best model parameters.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the trained model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error and RÂ² Score.
